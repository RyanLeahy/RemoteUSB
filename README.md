# RemoteUSB
Project is pretty basic. I turned a rasberry pi into a usb drive and I want to be able to put files on it remotely. The scope of the project is to have a UI to upload files to the pi and delete files off of the pi. This project involves me to learn a bit about networking as well as different protocols such as SSH Sftp and SCP
