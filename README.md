# RemoteUSB
Project is pretty basic. I turned a rasberry pi into a usb drive and I want to be able to put files on it remotely. The scope of the project is to have a UI to upload files to the pi and delete files off of the pi. This project involves me to learn a bit about networking as well as different protocols such as SSH and Sftp. If anyone is interested in replicating this for their own use message me and I'll add a tutorial and more to the settings so you too can use this program.
